# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student performance data using machine learning and statistical methods. 
The goal is to explore patterns in the data and build predictive models to identify factors influencing academic success.

## Overview
The project leverages the **UCI Student Performance Dataset**, focusing on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights.
- Preprocessing and cleaning data for machine learning tasks.
- Building models to predict student grades and performance metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset includes demographic, academic, and social attributes of students, with their grades as the target variable. Key features include:
- `studytime`: Weekly study hours.
- `failures`: Past class failures.
- `absences`: Number of school absences.
- `G1`, `G2`, `G3`: Grades for different periods.

## Requirements
Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rahulpoojith/student-performance-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Student_performance_UCI_Learning.ipynb
    ```

3. Run the cells to execute the analysis and model-building process.

## Features
- **EDA**: Visualizing relationships between features like study time, absences, and grades.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and data normalization.
- **Machine Learning**: Building regression models to predict final grades.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R-squared for model assessment.

## Results
- The analysis reveals critical factors influencing student performance.
- Models achieved significant accuracy in predicting final grades.
